Hi! I'm currently a visiting researcher at [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu/) working with [Prof. Jean Oh](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~./jeanoh/) in the Bot Intelligence Group at [the Robotics Institute](https://www.ri.cmu.edu/). My research interests lie in deep generative models at the intersection of vision and language. Previously, I received **B.S. in Computer Science** and **B.A. in English Linguistics** from [Dongguk University](https://www.dongguk.edu/eng/main), Seoul, Korea in 2022.
